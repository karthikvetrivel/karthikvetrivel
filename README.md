Hey! Thanks for dropping by. My name is [Karthik Vetrivel](https://karthikvetrivel.com), a computer science undergraduate at Stanford University. I love to tackle meaningful technical challenges and get my hands dirty. Most recently, I've worked on a joint project between Meta and Stanford investigating using virtual reality for synthesizing human motion.
